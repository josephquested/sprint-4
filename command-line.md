Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay-person (e.g. your mum):

Normally you use your computer with a keyboard and mouse, and you click on and move around files and folders. The command line is just another way to do the same thing. Instead of seeing little icons of files and folers on your screen that represent data inside your computer, you input text into a program that performs tasks for you. For example, you might might make a new folder in your documents folder by right clicking and selecting "Create new folder". On the command line, you can accomplish the same task by typing, "cd Documents && mkdir". Regardless of whether you are using a mouse and keyboard or the command line, you are still just interacting with an interface. The command line isn't magic; you're not actually any DEEPER inside the computer than when you click on something with a mouse. It is just a different way of interacting with the data that is stored inside your computer.

list 10 terminal commands in plain english: 

ls (List): When typed, this simply gives you a list of all the files and folders that are in the part of the computer you are currently looking at. Imagine it like this: you enter a dark kitchen, and upon speaking the word “ls", somebody quietly whispers in your ear all of the objects that are in the kitchen. 

cd (Change Directory): This is how you navigate around the rooms in that dark house I mentioned. The room you are currently in is called a “directory”. An example of this is a documents folder or your computer desktop. Say you had a folder within your documents folder, called “unfinished”. You could type into the command line, “cd unfinished” and enter that directory. This is like if you were in the dark kitchen, and you wanted to go into the dark living room. You would say aloud, “cd living room”, and move there. 

sudo (Superuser Do): This command prefaces other commands. It gives you the ability to do things that are usually forbidden. Imagine you are not allowed to enter the locked bathroom in the dark house, you could say allowed “sudo cd bathroom”, and force your way in. But you probably shouldn’t; it’s rude.  

mkdir (Make Directory): Lets say I want to create a bookcase in my nice dark living room, I could do so by saying “mkdir bookcase”. It is much easier than real carpentry.  

mv (Move): This is how you move things from one place to another, or change the name of something. The bookcase in the dark living room, but realise it is actually a bookSHELF, you could say aloud, “mv bookcase bookshelf”. 

cp (Copy): Now you decide that you have too many books, and you need TWO bookshelves. You could say to yourself, “cp bookshelf bookshelf2”. And poof, another one appears as if by magic. 

diff (Difference): Then you’re curious, are all the books exactly the same in those two bookshelves? I better check, so I’m going to say, “diff bookshelf bookshelf2” and analyse any potential differences between those two bookshelves. I don’t even know why I need all these books in the first place, this room is too dark for reading.  

wc (Wordcount): Now lets say I got a book out of one of these bookshelves, that book is called cookbook.txt. I can determine, as if by magic, how many lines, words, and characters are in that book, simply by saying, “wc cookbook.txt”. But remember, I must be in the same room (or ‘directory’) as that book. Weirdly, in this situation, I might actually need to climb inside the bookshelf to be able to read the book, and I could do so by saying “cd bookshelf”. 

rm (Remove): Upon reading this cookbook, it turns out it’s all barbecue recipes, and I am a vegan. I won’t be needing this book after all, so I’m going to throw it away. It’s even more intense than that really, I’m not just throwing it away, I am destroying its very existence. I can do this by shouting the magic words, “rm cookbook.txt”. 

whoami(Who am I?): This final command is very special. In the event that you have an existential crisis. (Which we all do, from time to time). You can scream into the darkness, “whoami”!?! and an etherial voice will reply “josephquested”. Or at least, that’s what happens to me. If the voice says “josephquested” to you, we’ve really got a problem on our hands.
